message -> 128 bit (fingerprint,message digest)
word = 32-bit thingy
bye = 8 bit thingy
x_i = exp x_1,x_2
x^i = exp x^3 x * x* x
XvY = Bitwise OR
X Y = Bitwise AND

So first I have to see my input as just a list of bits basically

Step 1

append bits (trash)  one single 1 bit and then 0 Bits til it has a reminder of 448 when  devided by 51.

Step 2 get the lengh of the original mesg and * 8 for bits and then append the number as u64 to the end of step one 


Step 3 initialize buffer called a b c d with values form docs


Step 4 cry
so first we create 4 functions called ( f, g , h, j)

then we need to change or u8 vec to 32 bit values u32
