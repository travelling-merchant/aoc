# aoc
repo containing my aoc code

i decided to challange me to only use vi or vim, (no nvim) without lsp,
cargo,  llms or other means except the offical rust documentation

to use the files type
```cli
rustc rustfile.rs

./rustfile

```

additional notes

I made a exception on technical docs like the md5 docs to use ai and other docs.
so even someone like me can understand it in a reasonble time.

further challange ideas 

solve a year without clone
use only hex as values
use only binarry numbers
disable undo and undo undo fully
